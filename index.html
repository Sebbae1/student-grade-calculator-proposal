    Final Notes:
    I have implement a majority of what I wanted in my class product proposal in my final project. However, 
    one of the few things I would like to add was different grading scales that could have been opened 
    in a new browser. I would like to add a few more of those advanced components into my application as I continue 
    to gain knowledge. I could add more columns and rows in the table so users can add more grades in.
    For future enhancements, contact me. Email: seb.basti2004@gmail.com
